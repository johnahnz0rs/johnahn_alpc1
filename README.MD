Thank you so much, Art + Logic, for this very cool test. Despite the 1-hour estimate to complete this test, I took a total of 9H 23M.

I took an extra 8.5 hours because I had previously never encountered bits, bytes, bit-masking, converting to/from binary/decimal/hexadecimal. To be honest, I've never even written vanilla JavaScript because I've always used Angular, React, and/or jQuery. It is reasonable to think that I might have gone my entire career without ever encountering any of the above listed items. So I sincerely thank you for giving me a reason to face these new concepts.

* The first 4.5 hours of my total time were spent literally googling and stackoverflowing all the terms with which I was unfamiliar.
* The next 3 hours were spent just playing around with the sample values and trying to get the expected results.
* My final 2 hours were spent having fun with HTML and cleaning up my JavaScript (my code is usually littered with console.logs... like, a sea of console.logs).

Thanks again for the opportunity, A+L, and I hope you have as much fun reviewing my submission as I had completing it.


Yours truly,
